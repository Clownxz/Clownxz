#### About me:

I develop games and applications as a hobby.

I primarily work on Roblox, having the most experience in the Lua/Luau Programming Language. I design games, UI/UX, and more.
On Roblox, I currently lead the Development team and assume the role of Community Manager for Bloodxz's SCP Foundation group on Roblox (10k+ Members).

Outside of Roblox, I create Rust and JavaScript Applications, 3D Model, and do Graphic Design. Though not as good as my knowledge in Lua/Luau, I do know the JavaScript Programming Language and currently learning the Rust Programming Language. I primarily use these languages to create applications on Discord.
